# Baseline Results

This repository contains the evaluation results and outputs from the baselines in paper: *[Revisiting, Benchmarking and Exploring API Recommendation: How Far Are We?](https://www.yunpeng.site/files/apirec.pdf)*

To facilitate further research on API recommendation and reduce the burden of re-implementing different baselines, we release all the evaluation results and outputs of 11 baselines along with 4 IDEs discussed in the paper.

## DownLoad Experiment Results

You can download the results at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PizGwleBrOqUIXxH90kSuD9irNEfc2aM?usp=sharing).

## Query-based API Recommendation Baselines

We include the results of query-based baselines in path `baseline_results/querybased`.

The outputs are in `baseline_results/querybased/output` and each ouput file is in `json` format with structures corresponding to the [benchmark dataset](https://github.com/JohnnyPeng18/APIBench).

The detailed evaluation results (partially shown in the paper) are in `baseline_results/querybased/evaluation` and are in `csv` formats.

Currently the repo contains the results of the following query-based API recommendation baselines:

| Baseline       | Description                                                  | PL   | Venue | Year |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ----- | ---- |
| RACK           | RACK is a class-level recommendation approach that leverages keyword and API co-occurrence information to make predictions. | Java | ICSE  | 2016 |
| KG-APISumm     | KG-APISumm is a class-level recommendation approach that builds an API knowledge graph to provide API class recommendations with detailed summaries. | Java | FSE   | 2019 |
| Naive Baseline | We build  an API-level naive baseline that only calculates the similarity score between API descriptions provided by official documentation and queries based on BERTOverflow to recommend API classes. It indicates the basic performance of similarity-based methods. | Any  | -     | 2021 |
| DeepAPI        | DeepAPI is an API-level recommendation approach that uses an encoder-decoder model to convert words into APIs. | Java | FSE   | 2016 |
| Lucene         | Luceneis a popular java library providing powerful indexing and search features. Given a query, it can be used as a search engine to search related APIs in the official documentation. | Any  | -     | 2021 |
| BIKER          | BIKER is a method-level recommendation approach that leverages both Stack Overflow posts and API documentations to recommend APIs for a programming task. It fetches the top-k similar Stack Overflow posts to narrow down the scope of API candidates. | Java | ASE   | 2018 |

## Code-based API Recommendation Baselines

We include the results of query-based baselines in path `baseline_results/codebased`.

As  discussed in the paper, we conduct two different scales of experiment using our `full_dataset` and `sampled_dataset`.

The outputs and detailed evaluation results are in the folder of `output` and `evaluation` under `baseline_results/codebased/full_dataset` and `baseline_results/codebased/sampled_dataset`.

Each ouput file is in `json` format with structures corresponding to the [benchmark dataset](https://github.com/JohnnyPeng18/APIBench).

The detailed evaluation results (partially shown in the paper) are in `csv` formats.

Currently the repo contains the results of the following code-based API recommendation baselines:

| Baseline      | Description                                                  | PL     | Venue | Year |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ----- | ---- |
| TravTrans     | TravTrans encodes AST  node sequences generated by pre-order traversal into Transformer and predicts the masked AST nodes that correspond to some certain tokens in the source code. | Python | ICSE  | 2021 |
| PyART         | PyART leverages a predictive model trained on data flow information, token similarity and token co-occurrence based on the Random Forest algorithm to recommend APIs. | Python | ICSE  | 2021 |
| Deep3         | Deep3 is a general approach for building probabilistic models of code based on learning decision trees. The decision trees are represented as program in a domain specific language (DSL) called TGEN which is agnostic to programming languages. | Python | ICML  | 2016 |
| FOCUS         | FOCUS leverages the idea of traditional recommendation systems and uses a 3D matrix to represent the relationship between different projects, functions and APIs. | Java   | ICSE  | 2019 |
| PAM           | PAM builds a probabilistic model to mine the most ''interesting''  API patterns in certain projects. | Java   | FSE   | 2016 |
| PAM-MAX       | As PAM is originally a context-insensitive API recommendation approach, we build PAM-MAX by selecting the most correct API recommendation among all API patterns mined in the training set. It indicates the theoretical maximum performance a context-insensitive approach can reach when it can always find the most related projects to mine API patterns. | Java   | -     | 2021 |
| PyCharm       | -                                                            | Python | IDE   | 2021 |
| VSCode        | -                                                            | Python | IDE   | 2021 |
| Eclipse       | -                                                            | Java   | IDE   | 2021 |
